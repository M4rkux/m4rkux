### Hi there 👋

My name is Marcus

- 🔭 I’m currently working on frontend with [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OCR with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Go](https://go.dev/)
  - All the good study material that I found online is for Python, but I'm trying to replicate it on Go since it's faster and cooler 😎
- 🐧 I use Arch BTW
